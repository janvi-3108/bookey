            <p>I am not Jessica Chen</p>
            <div>
                <p>
                    After getting rejected by every single Ivy League she applied to and falling short of all her Asian
                    immigrant parents’ expectations, seventeen-year-old Jenna Chen makes a wish to become her smarter,
                    infinitely more successful Harvard-bound cousin, Jessica Chen—only for her wish to come true.
                    Literally.

                <p>
                    Now trapped inside Jessica’s body, with access to Jessica’s most private journals and secrets, Jenna
                    soon discovers that being the top student at the elite, highly competitive Havenwood Private Academy
                    isn’t quite what she imagined. Worse, as everyone—including her own parents—start having trouble
                    remembering who Jenna Chen is, or if she ever even existed, Jenna must decide if playing the role of
                    the perfect daughter and student is worth losing her true self forever.
